# CSIT121Object-Oriented-Design-and-Programming
This project was developed as part of my coursework for CSIT121 â€“ Object-Oriented Design and Programming at University of Wollongong. The subject focuses on the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, including concepts such as:

Classes and Objects,
Inheritance and Polymorphism,
Encapsulation,
File I/O operations,
Error handling,
Data validation,
Basic data visualization and reporting.

Through this assignment, I gained hands-on experience in designing structured and maintainable code using OOP principles. The project demonstrates my ability to build a real-world application that loads, processes, visualizes, and reports data effectively.
